// In CodeGuppy the canvas is 800 pixels wide and 600 pixels high
// This means we have 800 x 600 = 480,000 total pixels on the canvas.
// We refer to these numbers as the resolution of the canvas.

// CodeGuppy considers the first pixel as being the one in the upper-left corner. This pixel has coordinates (0, 0).
