// Cameras
// In order to grant the joy of exploration and discovery it becomes important for the game world to be larger 
// than what a player immediately sees upon entering the game. A useful way to convince the player of your game 
// of this is by employing the use of cameras. A camera is a view of the game world. Some games (those with 
//     mini-maps, for instance) employ multiple cameras, but we will be focusing on just using one.

// Phaser creates a camera by default, which we have so far been using without any customization. Its bounds are 
// set to be the same as the dimensions for your Game given in config. It also does not move at all, but we will 
// be changing both of those things for our platformer.

// create() {
//   gameState.player = this.physics.add.sprite(100, 100, 'codey');
//   this.cameras.main.setBounds(0, 0, 2000, 600);
//   this.cameras.main.startFollow(gameState.player);
// }
// Above we modified the default camera, this.cameras.main, to make it aware that the world is larger than our 
// current window. We do this by calling .setBounds() and giving bounds larger than our config width and height. 
// We also tell the camera to follow along our main player by calling .startFollow() and passing it the sprite 
// we want to follow.

// The .startFollow() method also has several additional optional arguments you can pass which we can use to 
// customize how fast the camera locks-on to its target and whether the target should be in the center of the 
// screen exactly or offset somewhat. Here are the arguments for .startFollow(): (target, roundPixels, lerpX, 
// lerpY, offsetX, offsetY).

// target is the sprite for the camera to follow
// roundPixels is a boolean that effects rendering, set it to true if you’re experiencing camera jitter.
// lerpX and lerpY are the speed (between 0 and 1, defaults to 1) with which the camera locks on to the target. 
// A lower lerp speed will have the effect that your character is moving much faster than the camera.
// offsetX and offsetY is the offset for the camera. Set offsetX to something like -200 will keep Codey on the left 
// side of the screen (so that more of the level ahead is on the screen).
